        <h2>PhysSim</h2>
        <p>During lockdown, GCSE and A level students were no longer able to perform the experiments that are crucial to their physics courses. 
            I thus created PhysSim in an effort to make virtual learning more engaging. 
            PhysSim is a web app where GCSE and A level teachers can create "classrooms" which students can join, 
            and set quizzes as homework which are automatically marked. The webapp also includes a basic physics simulator, 
            allowing students to set up experiments similar to some of those within their courses.
            The main website is no longer live due to associated costs, but an earlier (buggy) version of the physics simulator can be found 
            <a href="https://owenpauptit.github.io/PhysSim/"> here</a>. </p>
