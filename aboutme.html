      Hi, I'm Owen. I'm a computer science and mathematics undergraduate at the University of Edinburgh. 
      <br/><br/>
      I began developing about five years ago, 
      and since then I've taught myself a bunch of different languages as my interests varied,
      creating many little projects as I went along - many of which you can find here!

    As well as messing around with code, I love the outdoors. 
    I particularly enjoy running and rock climbing.
    
    <br/><br/>
    This passion has lead me to some of my fondest personal achievements
    including finishing 10th in a 30-mile mountain marathon, and
    summitting Mount Kilimanjaro after fundraising Â£2820 for deprived Kenyan communities.
    <br/><br/>
    The photo on the left is from a recent trail half marathon where I set a new personal best!
