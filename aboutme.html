        <h2>Who I am</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Owen Pauptit, a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh interested in ecological statistics. 
            I graduated with a first in Computer Science and Mathematics Bsc (Hons) from the University of Edinburgh in 2025, 
            although much of my undergraduate studies had a strong focus on statistics.
        </p>
        <h2>Conservation Volunteering</h2>
        <p>I'm a strong believe in conservation and resotration, so spend most of my weekends with the Lothians Conservation Volunteers.
            I currently act as the Tools Officer for the charity as well as one of the Task Leaders.
        </p>
        <h2>Hill running, rock climbing and wild swimming</h2>
        <p>I love spending time outdoors, almost regardless of the activity! 
            In the past I've enjoyed ultramarathons, traditional rock climbing, cycle touring and much more.
        Recently, I've been getting into wild swimming and I try to go for a dip whenever the opportunity arises!
        </p>
