# Who am I?

**I am an A level student studying Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics and Chemistry. I have found a passion for programming, and enjoy creating games as a way to learn programming languages and any respective libraries. I started learning [Python](/PythonPage.md) (my very first programming language in 2018) and [C++](/CppPage.md) late 2019. As of March 2020, I have begun learning [C#](/CsPage.md) - the language that I have decided to use for my A level Computer Science coursework.**

## C# Projects

I decided in March 2020, that for my A level coursework a language like C# or Java would be more suitable. I chose C# due to my familiarity with visual studio from my experience with C++. I initially found the classes in C# confusing after programming for a few months in C++, so started off by created text-based programs that ran in the console.
