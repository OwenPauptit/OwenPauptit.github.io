# Who am I?

**I am an A level student studying Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics and Chemistry. I have found a passion for programming, and enjoy creating games as a way to learn programming languages and any respective libraries. I started learning [Python](/PythonPage.md) (my very first programming language in 2018) and [C++](/CppPage.md) late 2019. As of March 2020, I have begun learning [C#](/CsPage.md) - the language that I have decided to use for my A level Computer Science coursework.**

## [C# Projects](README.md "Home")

I decided in March 2020, that for my A level coursework a language like C# or Java would be more suitable. I chose C# due to my familiarity with visual studio from my experience with C++. I initially found the classes in C# confusing after programming for a few months in C++, so started off by creating some simple [text-based programs that run in the console](#text-based-programs). 

#### Text-based Programs

- **Mastermind**

Mastermind is a game that involves the use of several colours (Orange, blue, red, green, pink, white and yellow). Four of these colours are chosen by the computer and placed in a random order.

The player has ten guesses to find the order of the colours. Each time the player makes a guess, they are told how many are the correct colour and correct position, and how manya re the correct colour but incorrect position. For example...

If the code is

> **YPRB** *(Yellow Pink Red Blue)*

And the user guesses

> **YOBR** *(Yellow Orange Blue Red)*

the computer will output:

```
    Correct colour, correct position:     1
    Correct colour, incorrect position:   2
```

As you can see, the **Y** is in the correct position, but the **B** and **R** are both present in the code, but are not in the correct position.

The player wins when they guess the correct combination.
