# Who am I?

**I am an A level student studying Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics and Chemistry. I have found a passion for programming, and enjoy creating games as a way to learn programming languages and any respective libraries. I started learning [Python](#python-projects) (my very first programming language in 2018) and [C++](#c-projects) late 2019.**

## Python Projects

With python, I have mostly used the [pygame](#pygame) libraries, but have also experimented with some other libraries such as the [Panda3d Game Engine](#panda-3d).

#### Pygame

- **Garden Defence**

Garden Defence is my own tower defence strategy game. Players place different gnomes into the garden to fight the attacking insects. Money is earned from killing enemies, and can be used to buy more gnomes or upgrade existing gnomes. Upgrades can be bought by clicking the existing gnome, clicking the upgrade arrow, and then choosing between increasing range or power.

The majority of the game is played using only a mouse (or touchscreen), with the only exception being the ability to cancel a gnome placement using the escape button on the keyboard.

- **Maze Generator**

This program generates a maze that the user can then use the arrow keys to navigate the player (red) and reach the finish square (green).

The generation part of the program uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to create the maze, which can be viewed when "Show Maze Generation" is selected in the set up menu.

Once the maze has been created, the user can then try to reach the finishing square (indicated by a green square) using the arrow keys on the keyboard. If the user completes the maze, they can choose to play either an easier maze, a harder maze or a maze of the same difficulty. Or, the user can press 'S' to go to the set up menu, where they can manually set the size of the grid.

- **Snake**

Snake is a simple game in which the player uses the arrow keys to control the snakes movement. The player aims to eat the fruit (indicated by the red square) which causes the snake to grow. The player dies if the snake's head touches it's body or the walls of the game area. There are basic settings window's which allow the user to change the size of the grid, the speed of the snake and the number of fruit.

- **Mitosis**

Mitosis is the process of cell division. This program initially creates a single cell which moves around randomly, at random velocities calculated from the velocity in the previous frame. When a cell is left-clicked by the mouse, it divides creating two new cells both of which have half the radius of the parent, and inherit some of the parents qualities, such as it's speed before division, and colour. However these qualities mutate slightly creating two slightly different cells.

A cell will grow if it is right-clicked by the mouse, and no other qualities will change. This means that the simulation can continue to evolve without the cells becoming too small to see. A cell can be killed by using the middle mouse button, allowing a user to remove any unwanted cells. The simulation will reset if the 'R' button is pressed on the keyboard.
