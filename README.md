**I am an A level student studying Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics and Chemistry. I have found a passion for programming, and enjoy creating games as a way to learn programming languages and any respective libraries. I started learning Python (my very first programming language in 2018) and C++ late 2019.**

## Python Projects

With python, I have mostly used the _pygame_ libraries, but have also experimented with some otehr libraries such as the _Panda3d_ Game Engine.

#### Pygame

- Dropper Dodge

- Calculator

- 2048

- Painter

- Snake

- Rain

- Mitosis

- Maze Generator

- Garden Defence
