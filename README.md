**I am an A level student studying Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics and Chemistry. I have found a passion for programming, and enjoy creating games as a way to learn programming languages and any respective libraries. I started learning Python (my very first programming language in 2018) and C++ late 2019.**

## Python Projects

With python, I have mostly used the **pygame** libraries, but have also experimented with some other libraries such as the **Panda3d** Game Engine.

#### Pygame

- **Garden Defence**

Garden Defence is a tower defence strategy game. Players place different gnomes into the garden to fight the attacking insects. Money is earned from killing enemies, and can be used to buy more gnomes or upgrade existing gnomes.
