**I am an A level student studying Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics and Chemistry. I have found a passion for programming, and enjoy creating games as a way to learn programming languages and any respective libraries. I started learning Python (my very first programming language in 2018) and C++ late 2019.**

## Python Projects

With python, I have mostly used the **pygame** libraries, but have also experimented with some other libraries such as the **Panda3d** Game Engine.

#### Pygame

- Dropper Dodge

- Calculator

- 2048

- Painter

- Snake

- Rain

- Mitosis

- Maze Generator

- Garden Defence

## C++ Projects

I recently started learning C++, and soon after, I started experimenting with the **SFML** libraries.

#### SFML

- Flappy Bird

- Pong

- Noughts and Crosses
