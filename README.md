# Who am I?

**I am an A level student studying Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics and Chemistry. I have found a passion for programming, and enjoy creating games as a way to learn programming languages and any respective libraries. I started learning [Python](#python-projects) (my very first programming language in 2018) and [C++](#c-projects) late 2019.**
