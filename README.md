# Who am I?

**I am an A level student studying Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics and Chemistry. I have found a passion for programming, and enjoy creating games as a way to learn programming languages and any respective libraries. I started learning [Python](#python-projects) (my very first programming language in 2018) and [C++](#c-projects) late 2019.**

## Python Projects

With python, I have mostly used the [pygame](#pygame) libraries, but have also experimented with some other libraries such as the [Panda3d Game Engine](#panda-3d).

#### Pygame

- **Garden Defence**

Garden Defence is my own tower defence strategy game. Players place different gnomes into the garden to fight the attacking insects. Money is earned from killing enemies, and can be used to buy more gnomes or upgrade existing gnomes. Upgrades can be bought by clicking the existing gnome, clicking the upgrade arrow, and then choosing between increasing range or power.

The majority of the game is played using only a mouse (or touchscreen), with the only exception being the ability to cancel a gnome placement using the escape button on the keyboard.

- **Maze Generator**

This program generates a maze that the user can then use the arrow keys to navigate the player (red) and reach the finish square (green).

The maze generator uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to create the mazes, you can enable/disable several different setitngs as well as modifying values such as the grid size in the set up menu. The set up menu can be accessed after completing any game, and pressing 'S'.

- **Snake**

Snake is a simple game in which the player uses the arrow keys to control the snakes movement. The player aims to eat the fruit (indicated by the red square) which causes the snake to grow. The player dies if the snake's head touches it's body or the walls of the game area. There are basic settings window's which allow the user to change the size of the grid, the speed of the snake and the number of fruit.
