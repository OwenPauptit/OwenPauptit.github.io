# Who am I?

**I am an A level student studying Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics and Chemistry. I have found a passion for programming, and enjoy creating games as a way to learn programming languages and any respective libraries.**

**I started learning [Python](/PythonPage.md) (my very first programming language in 2018) and [C++](/CppPage.md) late 2019. As of March 2020, I have begun learning [C#](/CsPage.md) - the language that I have decided to use for my A level Computer Science coursework.**

## [Featured](README.md)

This is a collection of what I believe to be my most important projects.
