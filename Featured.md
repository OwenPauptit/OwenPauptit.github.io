# Who am I?

**I am an A level student studying Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics and Chemistry. I have found a passion for programming, and enjoy creating games as a way to learn programming languages and any respective libraries.**

**I started learning [Python](/PythonPage.md) (my very first programming language in 2018) and [C++](/CppPage.md) late 2019. As of March 2020, I have begun learning [C#](/CsPage.md) - the language that I have decided to use for my A level Computer Science coursework.**

## [Featured](README.md)

This is a collection of what I believe to be my most important projects.

####  • Conway's Game of Life

####  • Garden Defence

Garden Defence is my own tower defence strategy game. Players place different gnomes into the garden to fight the attacking insects. Money is earned from killing enemies, and can be used to buy more gnomes or upgrade existing gnomes. Upgrades can be bought by clicking the existing gnome, clicking the upgrade arrow, and then choosing between increasing range or power.

The majority of the game is played using only a mouse (or touchscreen), with the only exception being the ability to cancel a gnome placement using the escape button on the keyboard and renaming save game files (which can be done by right clicking on a save file and typing on the keyboard).

#### • Maze Generator

This program generates a maze that the user can then use the arrow keys to navigate the player (red) and reach the finish square (green).

The generation part of the program uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to create the maze, which can be viewed when "Show Maze Generation" is selected in the set up menu.

Once the maze has been created, the user can then try to reach the finishing square (indicated by a green square) using the arrow keys on the keyboard. If the user completes the maze, they can choose to play either an easier maze, a harder maze or a maze of the same difficulty. Or, the user can press 'S' to go to the set up menu, where they can manually set the size of the grid.
