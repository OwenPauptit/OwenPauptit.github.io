    Hi, I'm Owen. I'm a computer science and mathematics undergraduate at the University of Edinburgh. 
    <br/><br/>
    I began developing when I was about 15 years old, 
    and since then I've taught myself a bunch of different languages as my interests varied,
    creating many little projects as I went along - many of which you can find here!
    <br/><br/>
    <!-- I started as many do, recreating 2D games in pygame.
    I then progressed into creating windows desktop applications in C++ and C#, 
    beginning with 2D games before exploring algorithm visualisation.
    C# opened my eyes to the possibilities of web development using ASP.NET and Blazor,
    which is when I developed PhysSim.
    I then decided to tune my vanilla javascript skills before beginning my degree,
    which has since brought me to dabble all over the spectrum, including Haskell, Java, MIPS, C and matplotlib.
    <br/><br/> -->
    As well as problem solving, I love the outdoors. 
    Whether that's mountain running, trad climbing, open water swimming, summitting big mountains, you name it.
    
    <br/><br/>
    This passion has lead me to some of my fondest personal achievements
    including finishing 10th in a 30-mile mountain marathon with over 10,000ft of climb, 
    and reaching the top of Mount Kilimanjaro after fundraising Â£2820 for the local communities.
