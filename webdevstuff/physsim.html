    During lockdown I realised that GCSE and A level students were no longer
    able to perform the experiments that are so crucial to their physics courses. 
    So I created PhysSim during lockdown in an effort to make virtual learning more engaging.
      <br/><br/>
    PhysSim is a web app where GCSE and A level teachers can create "classrooms" which students can join, 
    and set quizzes as homework which are automatically marked.
      <br/><br/>
    PhysSim also includes a basic physics simulator, allowing students to set up experiments similar to some of those within their courses.
    <br/><br/>
    The main website is no longer live due to associated costs, but the physics simulator can be found <a href="https://owenpauptit.github.io/PhysSim">here</a>.
    The GIF on the left is video evidence of some of the tests of the mobile website.
