# Who am I?

**I am an A level student studying Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics and Chemistry. I have found a passion for programming, and enjoy creating games as a way to learn programming languages and any respective libraries. I started learning [Python](#python-projects) (my very first programming language in 2018) and [C++](#c-projects) late 2019.**

## C++ Projects

I recently started learning C++, and soon after, I started experimenting with the [SFML](#sfml) libraries.

- **Conway's Game of Life**

This program is a simulation of Conway's Game of Life using SFML.

Conway's game of life is a zero player game, which takes a single input, then computes the following generations. It consists of a grid of cells which can either be alive or dead. When the next generation is calculated, the cells live or die depending on 3 rules:

> - If a living cell is surrounded by less than two other cells, it dies of underpopulation
> - If a living cell is surrounded by more than three other cells, it dies of overpopulation
> - if a dead cell is surrounded by exactly three other cells, it is born

The surrounding cells of a cell are the 8 cells neighbouring that cell, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

White squares represent alive cells, and black squares represent dead cells.

Currently, the game can be started with a seed input, or a preset. The seed is used to generate a grid of cells, and the presets read in the state of the cells in the grid from a text file.
