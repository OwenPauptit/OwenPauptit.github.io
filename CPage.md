# Who am I?

**I am an A level student studying Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics and Chemistry. I have found a passion for programming, and enjoy creating games as a way to learn programming languages and any respective libraries. I started learning [Python](#python-projects) (my very first programming language in 2018) and [C++](#c-projects) late 2019.**

## C++ Projects

I recently started learning C++, and soon after, I started experimenting with the [SFML](#sfml) libraries.

#### SFML

- **Conway's Game of Life**

This program is a simulation of Conway's Game of Life using SFML.

Conway's game of life is a zero player game, which takes a single input, then computes the following generations. It consists of a grid of cells which can either be alive or dead. When the next generation is calculated, the cells live or die depending on 3 rules:

> - If a living cell is surrounded by less than two other cells, it dies of underpopulation
> - If a living cell is surrounded by more than three other cells, it dies of overpopulation
> - if a dead cell is surrounded by exactly three other cells, it is born

The surrounding cells of a cell are the 8 cells neighbouring that cell, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

White squares represent alive cells, and black squares represent dead cells.

The game can be started with a random or custom seed, or a preset (either choosing preset at the main menu and typing the name of the preset in the console, or choosing "Load from file" from the menu and typing the file path into the console). Currently, the presets are:

>   - Max
>   - Gosper Glider Gun
>   - Side Car Gun
>   - Gliderless Gun
>   - Double Gliderless Gun
>   - AK-94
